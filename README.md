# Awesome React and Next.js project starter

Starter template for React and Next.js projects packed with features like authentication, custom hooks, Tailwind support and many more.

## Documentation and wiki

Make sure to read our [extensive documentation](https://github.com/victorocna/awesome-react-starter/wiki) about using this starter template.

## Quick start

Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

Copy the example environment variables and update them if needed

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Where to start

The goal is to write real code in less than 5 minutes.

Explore the projects examples. With the local server started, follow these tasks:

- Create a new page in the `pages` folder with some random HTML
- Create a custom component in the `examples/components` folder and add it to the new page
- Add a new image in the `public/images` folder and reference it in your page using relative paths
- Test the new page, image and custom component from the browser
